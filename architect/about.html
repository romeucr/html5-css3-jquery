                <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Aliquid dignissimos aliquam sed odio quis? Illo veniam, sint qui iure unde esse nulla magnam voluptatem eaque quos culpa libero, distinctio soluta.</p>

                    <h2 class="h2-about">INTERACTIVE IS OUR DEFINING PHILOSOPHY.</h2>
                    <p>We chose our name carefully and purposefully. Interactive represents, in a single word, the experience of working with us – two-way. responsive. hands-on. direct. We believe that words have power in their ability to effectively capture the essence of experience. Interactive Design sums us up pretty darn good.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="img-and-text">

                    <h2 class="h2-about">RELATIONSHIPS ARE OUR TOP PRIORITY.</h2>
                    <p>We are relationship architects, building responsive and lasting connections with clients that best suit our capacities. We work collaboratively to reveal, develop and ultimately realize a client’s vision and, in so doing, earn our greatest asset – their trust. Successful projects are the outcome of our work because thriving relationships are our goal.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="img-and-text">

                    <h2 class="h2-about">OUR PROCESS IS PATIENCE.</h2>
                    <p>To build positive, lasting client relationships, we know that we must begin with understanding. Years of experience and hundreds of projects have confirmed that the path to success hinges not only on the design process, but on thoughtful listening and patient attention to the demands and nuances of a client and their culture.

                    <h2 class="h2-about">WE PLAY WELL WITH OTHERS.</h2>
                    <p>This is a bold statement, especially among architects. For many firms, collaborating with a fellow architect falls into the category of unspeakable horrors. We are not this type of firm. For us, collaboration is an opportunity…to create, to learn, to interact with other thought leaders in our profession.

                    <h2 class="h2-about">SMALL, BY DESIGN.</h2>
                    <p>We know that communication is better when it is direct. We believe that there is a price for asking our clients to navigate hierarchical layers and, frankly, it’s too high. Ours is a curated staff of experienced and capable leaders working to ensure our clients get exactly what they need – skill, discernment, creativity, attention, access – and nothing they don’t – layers, attitude, bureaucracy.
